Easily disable post formats or allow certain roles access to only certain formats.

== Description ==

Post Format Options is a simple plugin that allows administrators to granularly manage post formats.

* Completely disable post format usage. This will force everyone to use the standard format and make your post UI look like the pre-3.6 UI.
* Allow certain roles access to only certain formats. For example, one might only want the video post format available to contributors and up (Coming soon!).

** This plugin requires at least WordPress 3.6!
